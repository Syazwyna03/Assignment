      <h2>Hai, I am Syazwina Ezwin</h2>
      <p>I am a believer in justice and standing up for what is right. I am passionate about helping people and ensuring that everyone is treated fairly, no matter who they are.
        Being a lawyer means more than just knowing the law, it means using it to protect others and improve our society. The law is not just something I want to learn, it is something
        I truly care about. I hope to one day make a real difference by standing up for the rights of others and supporting justice in everything I do. This is my path.</p>
